Image Segmentation

Familiarising myself with python's data generator. Wrote a custom one and also imported one from keras Image Data Generator.
Also learnt about the proper workflow for segmentation task including image-mask augmentation, rle encode/decode.
Exposed to Unet which is a sutable model for image segmentation task.
